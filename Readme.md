# Taxi Project Part 2 - Week 4

Due date: Friday 14 May 2021

## New questions

### Exercise 16.26 
Add assertion and exception-throwing consistency checks within each class, to guard against inappropriate use. For instance, ensure that a Passenger is never created with pickup and destination locations that are the same; ensure that a taxi is never requested to go to a pickup when it already has a target location; etc. 

### Exercise 16.27 
Report on the statistical information that is being gathered by taxis and the passenger source; also on taxi idle time and missed pickups. Experiment with different numbers of taxis to see how the balance between these two sets of data varies. 

### Exercise 16.28 
Adapt the vehicle classes so that records are kept of the amount of time spent traveling to pickup locations and passenger destinations. Can you see a possible conflict here for shuttles?
